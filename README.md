# Blender Texture Oven

This is a fork of the BakeTool with some improvements that I did to have better workflow. 

I think that the Blender baking workflow, without any add-ons, is the worst workflow imaginable. At least, I cannot imagine anything worse. An inconvenient, inflexible, and incomprehensible tool that has potential, but in its current state, it forces people to move to other texturing tools. It's a shame, as Blender is very capable in this regard.
